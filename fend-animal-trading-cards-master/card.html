			The five species are: black-tailed, white-tailed, Gunnison's, Utah, and Mexican prairie dogs. 
			They are a type of ground squirrel, found in the United States, Canada and Mexico.
			In Mexico, prairie dogs are found primarily in the northern states, which lie at the southern end of the 
			Great Plains: northeastern Sonora, north and northeastern Chihuahua, northern Coahuila, northern Nuevo León,
			and northern Tamaulipas. In the United States, they range primarily to the west of the Mississippi River,
			though they have also been introduced in a few eastern locales. Despite the name, they are not canines.</p>
